This repo is for my portfolio website where I am showcasing my technical writing experience, published examples, before/after formatting work, and open-source contributions.

I also link to my secret art page, where I showcase my digital art, upcycled clothing, and original sticker designs.

My Substack page is available too. I started it recently, and I write articles whenever I have time.
