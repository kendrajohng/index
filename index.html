    <div class="w3-container">
        <p>While much of my contracted EPA work was proprietary, I’m able to share some public-facing documents from my contract with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Below is a selection of these texts.</p>
        <h5><b>1. Pre-Production Release Notes  | <a href="https://usepa.servicenowservices.com/sdwisprogram?id=kb_search&kb_knowledge_base=4251afe41b9705547b16ea04bc4bcbd2&spa=1&kb_category=571cfdf51baea1508e946311f54bcbd2">Read Here</b></a></h5>
